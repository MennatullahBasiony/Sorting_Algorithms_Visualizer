# Sorting Algrothims Visualizer

A small web application that visualize difference between sorting Algorithms

### Implemented algorithms:
* Bubble sort
* Selection sort
* Insertion sort
* Merge sort
* Quick sort
* Heap sort

#### Features:
1) Colored representation:
    * Blue: default
    * Yellow: Being compared
    * Red: Identified as in incorrect       position and to be moved
    * Green: In correct position
2) Controls added to visualizations
    * Speed of visualization (5 speed    levels)
    * Data size
    * Generation of new data (Randomly generate new data).
3) Time and Space complexity of algorithm being visualized.
